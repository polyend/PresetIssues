![Polyend Preset Product Image](./images/product-image.jpg)

This repository exists to enable community members to submit and track
known issues with the [Polyend Preset](https://polyend.com/preset/).
You can submit bug reports **as well as** feature requests here.

## The rules are simple

* **Check for duplicates** before submitting your bug report or idea.
  We might get a little grumpy if you don't.  First time on GitHub?
  No worries, the Search bar is right on the [Issues](https://github.com/polyend/PresetIssues/issues)
  page.  Just try a few queries for what you're looking for.

* **Always** refer to the particular firmware version you're currently
  using.  This is crucial for us to determine if the problem is still
  there or whether it's been already fixed.  To save yourself the
  trouble,
  [look here for the latest published firmware](https://polyend.com/downloads/).
  Your issue might already be addressed!  If you're interested in testing
  beta firmware, read [HOWTO_BETA_FIRMWARE.md](./HOWTO_BETA_FIRMWARE.md).

* A **clear English description** makes it easier for us to understand you.
  Please don't ignore the provided template!

## Attachments

Provide as many **attachments** as possible with your bug report.
We're especially looking for:

* direct links to videos where you show the bug;

* pictures (you can drag them into the edit box when submitting your
  bug report);

* zipped projects from the SD card.
